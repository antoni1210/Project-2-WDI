# Project 2: Vinyl Destination - Full-stack application

### Overview

Vinyl Destination is a record collection platform on which users can upload their collections and view other users' collections.

### Brief

The application should:

- Have at least 2 models â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of the application, e.g. vinyl records.
- Include authentication, with hashed passwords and authorisation flow.
- Use RESTful routing.
- Use SCSS as opposed to CSS.
- Be deployed online so that it can be accessed publicly.

### Challenges and issues

- This was my first time using a css framework (Bulma), so it took a little getting used to.
- I tried implementing a commenting feature that I couldn't get it to work.

### Wins

- The column-based layout looked pretty neat once I got to know Bulma.
- Getting authentication working for the first time was cool.

### Future developments and tweaks

- Re-visit the commenting feature so that users can comment on each others records.
- Adjust some of the styling to address some contrast issues, i.e. on the forms where some of the text washes into the background image.
- Enable users to exchange records with each other.
