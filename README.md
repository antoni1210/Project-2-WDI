# Project 2: Vinyl Destination - MERN-stack application (Group project)

### Overview

Vinyl Destination is a record collection platform on which users can upload their collections and view other users' collections.

### Brief

The application should:

- Have at least 2 models â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of the application, e.g. vinyl records.
- Include authentication, with hashed passwords and authorisation flow.
- Use RESTful routing.
- Use SCSS as opposed to CSS.
- Be deployed online so that it can be accessed publicly.

### Challenges and issues

- Being able to return the data we wanted from Ticketmaster's API and manipulate it in the way that we desired was trickier than expected.
- We initially got a little overwhelmed in terms of how heavily we might rely on the API's we used.
- A few merging issues set us back a little at times, but we were able to rectify these.

### Wins

- Despite a few merge hiccups, working as a team using Trello was very smooth.
- Eventually getting some of the data we wanted from Ticketmaster's API was a joyous occasion.

### Future developments and tweaks

- Being able to auto-populate a new ticket listing with predetermined data from Ticketmaster's API rather than the user having to input each field.
- Some of the colours used in the styling are a bit garish.
- Address some of the clunky UX.
